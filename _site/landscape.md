            <h4>Postcard: Landscape of the Great Wall of China, 2022</h4>
            <p>This postcard was a project that I created through Adobe Illustrator. I chose the Great Wall of China because it is a place I want to vist. I used the pen tool and layers to recreate a look of the Great Wall of China. I looked at different typefaces and fonts to see which would look best with the type of landscape I picked. This font fit with the caligraphy writing style which fitted perfectly with the landscape.</p>
